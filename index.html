                Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (17 March 1920 – 15 August 1975), shortened as Sheikh Mujib or just Mujib, 
                was a Bangladeshi politician and statesman. He is called the father of Nation in Bangladesh. 
                He served as the first President of Bangladesh and later as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh from 17 April 1971 
                until his assassination on 15 August 1975. 
                <br> <br>
                He is considered to be the driving force behind the independence of Bangladesh. 
                He is popularly dubbed with the title of "Bangabandhu" (Bôngobondhu "Friend of Bengal") by the people of Bangladesh.
                Mujib is credited as an important figure in efforts to gain political autonomy for East Pakistan and 
                later as the central figure behind the Bangladesh Liberation Movement and the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971.
                Thus, he is regarded "Jatir Janak" or "Jatir Pita" (meaning "Father of the Nation") of Bangladesh.

                <h3><i>Establishment of Bangladesh:</i></h3>
                <p>On the night of March 25, 1971, Pak army launched operation searchlight and 
                        started large scale genocide of the innocent Bengalis. Sheikh Mujib was arrested and taken to Pakistan. 
                        Before that, Mujib declared the independence of Bangladesh and asked the people to create resistance 
                        against the occupying Pak army.
                        On March 17, 1971, the first government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh was formed and 
                        Mujib was made the President of the country in his absence. Soon after that, Muktibahini, 
                        the freedom fighters’ force was formed and it started putting up strong resistance against the Pak army.
                        After nine months of bloody war which killed over 3 millions of Bengalis, the Pak army surrendered to the 
                        allied forces of Muktibahini and Indian army. A new nation is born- Bangladesh. 
                        Sheikh Mujibur Rahman returned home on January 10, 1972 and took the charge of 
                        reconstructing the war-torn country.

                <h3><i>Reconstruction:</i></h3>
                <p>In order to stabilize the econimical condition as well as the political situation, Mujib introduced one-party rule.
                        All political parties came under one umbrella of identity known as 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Krishak_Sramik_Awami_League" target="_blank">BAKSAL</a>.

                <h3><i>Assassination:</i></h3>
                <p>On the night of August 15, 1975, a group of wayward army officers assassinated Mujib and 
                        all of his family members except the two daughters. This brutal assassination not only put 
                        an indelible smudge in the newborn nation’s history, but led the country into a political vacuum. 
                        Democracy started fading away and the reconstruction process suffered a major setback.
